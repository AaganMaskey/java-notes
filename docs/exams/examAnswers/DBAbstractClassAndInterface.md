# Difference between Abstract Class and Interface

| An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract â€”it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract . | A Java interface is a bit like a class, except a Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields. An Java interface  cannot contain an implementation of the methods, only the signature  (name, parameters and exceptions) of the method. You can use interfaces in Java as a way to achieve polymorphism. |
| If we are talking about implementation, but not completely; we use abstract class.                                                                                                                                                                       | If we don't know about the implementation, just have requirements, go with interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| We can take abstract and concrete class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Method is public and abstract.
