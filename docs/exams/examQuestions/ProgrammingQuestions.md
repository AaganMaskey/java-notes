## Chapter 2

1. Write a program which has two classes A and B, where A should act as Parent class and B should inherit from A.
2. Create a class ```Employee``` with ```id, name, post and salary```. Create parameterized constructor to initialize the instance variables. Override the ```toString( )``` method to display the employee details.  
3.	Create a class Parts with instance variable ```sno, name, model, price```, constructors to initialize the object, a method to calculate commission which calculates 10% of the price of each item and a method to display the details. Derive a new class ```PartsVAT``` with a method to calculate 13% VAT of the item. Write necessary constructors to that use the super constructors. Test the classes using a main method in third classes.   
4.	Write an interface Exam with a method ```pass (int pass)``` that returns a Boolean. Write another interface Classify with a method ```division (int average)``` which returns a string. Write class ```Result``` which implements both Exams and Classify. The pass method should return true if score is greater than 50 otherwise false. The division method must return “First” when average is more than 80, “Second when average is more than 50 otherwise ”No Divison”.  
5.	Write a Java program to demonstrate runtime polymorphism via method overriding. Write the following classes: ```Animal``` as a base class, ```Cat``` (derived class of Animal) and ```Cow``` (derived class of Animal). Write a method ```eat( )``` in Animal class and override that method in the derived classes.   
6.	Implement an abstract class named ```Person``` and two subclasses named ```Student``` and ```Employee``` in Java. A person has a ```name, address, phone number``` and ```e-mail address```. A student has a class ```status (freshman, sophomore, junior or senior)```. Define the ```status``` as a constant. An employee has an ```office, salary and date-hired```. Implement the above classes in Java. Provide Constructors for classes to initialize private variables. Override the ```toString( )``` methods in each class to display class name and the person’s name. Write an application to create objects of type Student and Employee and print the person’s name and the class name of the objects.  
7.	Implement an abstract class named ```Book``` and two other subclasses named Novel and Magazine. A ```Book``` has a ```name, author,  total page``` and ```publisher```. Book has an abstract method called ```getBookType( )```. ```Novel``` and ```Magazine``` have field to determine their type. Implement the above classes in Java. Provide constructors for classes to private variables.  
8.	Make a class ```Human``` with a ```name``` and ```age```. Make a class ```Employee``` inherit from ```Human```. Add instance variable ```salary``` of double. Supply a method ```showData( )``` that prints the Employee’s ```name, age```, and ```salary```. Make a class ```Manager``` inherit from Employee. Supply appropriate ```showData( )``` methods for all classes. Provide a test program that tests these classes and methods.  
9. Create a class MyClass in a package ```MyPack```. Import newly created class ```MyClass``` form ```IpmClass```.  

## Chapter 3

1. Write a program to input an integer from keyboard and print it on the console. Fire an exception if the input is other than integer using try and catch.
2. Write a program to create your own Arithmetic Exception.  

## Chapter 4

1.	Write a program in Java to read a line of string in console mode and display same line as output. ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅
2.	Write a Java program to access an existing file in to your current directory.
3.	Write a program which stores and appends any String value given from keyword into the ```C:\store.txt```.
4.	Write a program to read a text file and display the content on screen.
5.	Write a program to read two integer numbers from the console using the Input Stream. Calculate their sum display in console.
6.	Write a program to store objects of a class Student into a file “student.dat” also reads the objects from same file and display the file state of objects on the screen. Handle possible exceptions.
7.	Write a program using any stream class for writing text to a file.
8.	Write a program to read content from file “```abc.txt```” and store it in “```xyz.txt```”.
9.	Write a program to write “```Hello World```” in a file ```abc.txt```.
