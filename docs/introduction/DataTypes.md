# Data Types

Java is strongly-typed language.

        int x = 10.5; ❌
        boolean b = 0; ❌

> Java doesn't support 1/0 as boolean data like C/C++ .

- Every variable and expression has a type.
- Every type is strictly defined.
- Every assignment should be checked by compile type compatibility.

### Note :

        if(1){ // Needs true / false.
            //doesn't run
        }

> No operator overloading, multiple inheritance are supported in Java.

### Syntax:

    data_type identifier = literal ;
