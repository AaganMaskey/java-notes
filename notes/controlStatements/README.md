description: Explains about Control Statement in Java in brief.
---

A control statement in java is a statement that determines whether the other statements will be executed or not. It controls the flow of a program.


## If Statement Examples

#### 1. Boolean Variable as Argument
```java
{% include 'controlStatements/testCases/ifElse/booleanVariableAssignmentAsArgument01.java' %}
```
#### 2. Integer Variable as Argument  
This doesn't compile as if statement expects boolean value as parameter.
```java
{% include 'controlStatements/testCases/ifElse/intAsArgument.java' %}
```
