Any constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called literal/constant. 

In simple words, Literals in Java is a synthetic representation of boolean, numeric, character, or string data. It is a medium of expressing particular values in the program, such as an integer variable named ‘’/count is assigned an integer value in the following statement.

```java
// Here 100 is a constant/literal.
int x = 100; 
```
