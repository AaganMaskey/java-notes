![constructor](https://static.javatpoint.com/images/core/java-constructor.png)

- A constructor initializes an object immediately upon creation.
- Constuctor has same name as the class it resides and it syntactically similar to a method.
- No return type no void. This is because the implicit return type of a class constructor is the class type itself.
- If not constructor provided, java itself create default constructor and assin default value to the variable.
